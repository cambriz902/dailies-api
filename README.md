# dailies-api

 API to allow users to create categories that will contain daily todos. Each time 
 a daily todo is completed the daily category will gain a point. This way the user
 can track how they are doing in each Category.

 Example:

 Category = {
  kind: 'Workout',
  total_points: 0,
  archived: false
 }

 Daily = {
  title: 'Run',
  Description: 'Run 3-5 miles',
  points: 1
 }
